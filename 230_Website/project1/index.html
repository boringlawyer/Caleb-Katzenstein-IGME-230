            <p>
                Blocker is a game about defense. There is a treasure, with<br />
                enemies moving toward it. The player is not represented on screen,<br />
                instead acting like an omnipresent protector, putting up barriers<br />
                to stop the enemies.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "subsection">
            <div class = "subheader">Genre</div>
            <p>
                Blocker is most similar to a tower defense game, but without the towers.<br />
                Instead of towers, you put up barriers in real time with a single mouse click.<br />
                There are also no paths enemies have to take. The entire screen is open to them.<br />
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "subsection">
            <div class = "subheader">Platform</div>
            <p>The priority is to have this on the web. But it would work well on mobile too.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "subsection">
            <div class = "subheader">Story</div>
            <p>
                This is an abstract game, so there is no story. The player's goal is to<br />
                protect the treasure for as long as possible. There are no themes (except<br />
                possibly for the futility of effort, as the player cannot truly win.)<br />
                There is no progression currently planned, aside from there being more enemies.<br />
                The mood is similar to arcade games (exciting).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "subsection">
            <div class = "subheader">Aesthetics</div>
            <p>
                The graphics will be simple, using rudimentary shapes. I will use similarly simple<br />
                sounds. There will be sounds for creating a barrier, destroying an enemy,<br />
                and when the game ends. Enemy areas that can be destroyed are in red. Impervious enemies are<br />
                in purple.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "subsection">
            <div class = "subheader">Gameplay</div>
            <p>
                The only way the player input is creating barriers with the left mouse button by clicking<br />
                and dragging. This can be replicated on mobile if possible. There will be no keyboard input.<br /><br />

                The game starts with a single standard enemy approaching the treasure. If the player does<br />
                nothing, the enemy will eventually make its way to the treasure and the game will start over.<br />
                It is up to the player to click on the mouse button, which will create the barrier and kill<br />
                the enemy. Then the game truly begins. The player will need to learn to be aware of many things<br />
                at once, always knowing how safe the treasure is and the most efficient way of protecting it.<br />
                One srategy is to kill multiple enemies with one barrier.
