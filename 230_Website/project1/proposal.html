            <p>
                Blocker is a game about defense. There is a treasure at the center of the screen, with<br />
                enemies moving toward it. The player is not represented on screen,<br />
                instead acting like an omnipresent protector, putting up barriers to stop<br />
                the enemies.<br />
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "subsection">
            <div class = "subheader">Genre</div>
            <p>
                Blocker is most similar to a tower defense game, but without the towers.<br />
                Instead of towers, you put up barriers in real time with clicking and dragging<br />
                your mouse. There are also no paths enemies have to take. The entire screen is <br />
                open to them.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "subsection">
            <div class = "subheader">Platform</div>
            <p>The priority is to have this on the web. But it would work well on mobile too, <br />
                replacing clicking and dragging with touch input.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "subsection">
            <div class = "subheader">Story</div>
            <p>
                This is an abstract game, so there is no story. The player's goal is to<br />
                protect the treasure for as long as possible. There are no themes (except<br />
                possibly for the futility of effort, as the player cannot truly win.)<br />
                There is no progression currently planned, aside from there being more enemies.<br />
                The mood is similar to arcade games (exciting, intense).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "subsection">
            <div class = "subheader">Aesthetics</div>
            <p>
                The graphics will be simple, using rudimentary shapes. I will use similarly simple<br />
                sounds, in the retro style. There will be sounds for creating a barrier, destroying an enemy,<br />  
                and when the game ends, as well as a general soundtrack. Enemy areas that can be destroyed are<br />
                in red. Impervious areas are in purple. The treasure will be a gold square. Barriers will be white.<br />
                There is a timer that counts up from when the game starts and stops when the game ends.<br />
                This acts like a score for the player.

            <div class = "subheader">Gameplay</div>
            <p>
                The only player input is creating barriers with the left mouse button by clicking<br />
                and dragging. This can be replicated on mobile if possible. There will be no keyboard input.<br />

                The game takes place from a top-down perspective. The game starts with a single standard enemy<br />
                approaching the treasure. If the player does nothing, the enemy will eventually make its way<br />
                to the treasure and the game will start over. It is up to the player to click on the mouse button<br />
                and drag the mouse, which will create the barrier and kill the enemy. Then the game truly begins.<br />
                The player will need to learn to be aware of many things at once, always knowing how safe the<br />
                treasure is and the most efficient way of protecting it. One strategy is to kill multiple<br />
                enemies with one barrier.<br /><br />

                A more specific example: There will be an enemy that, instead of moving continuously in a straight line,<br />
                zigs and zags towards the treasure. The player will have to anticipate where the enemy will go next to<br />
                defeat it. Because there are different types of enemies at different locations, the player will have to<br />
                prioritize which enemies to kill immediately.<br /><br />

                One last example: There is an enemy that consists of two invincible orbs rotating in a circular path.<br />
                This circles are connected by a vulnerable string. Once the player damages the string, the orbs fly off<br />
                in the direction of their tangential velocity. The player must make sure that the orbs don't fly into the<br />
                treasure.<br /><br />

                If a barrier hits a vulnerable part of an enemy, the enemy is destroyed. If a barrier hits an<br />
                invulnerable part, the barrier is destroyed.
