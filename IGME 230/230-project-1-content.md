# Blocker

## High Concept

Blocker is a game about defense. There is a treasure, with  
enemies moving toward it. The player is not represented on screen,  
instead acting like an omnipresent protector, putting up barriers to stop  
the enemies.

## Genre

Blocker is most similar to a tower defense game, but without the towers.  
Instead of towers, you put up barriers in real time with a single mouse click.  
There are also no paths enemies have to take. The entire screen is open to them.

## Platform

The priority is to have this on the web. But it would work well on mobile too.

## Story

This is an abstract game, so there is no story. The player's goal is to  
protect the treasure for as long as possible. There are no themes (except  
possibly for the futility of effort, as the player cannot truly win.)  
There is no progression currently planned, aside from there being more enemies.
The mood is similar to arcade games (exciting).

## Aesthetics

The graphics will be simple, using rudimentary shapes. I will use similarly simple  
sounds. There will be sounds for creating a barrier, destroying an enemy,  
and when the game ends. Enemy areas that can be destroyed are in red. Impervious enemies are  
in purple.

## Gameplay

The only way the player input is creating barriers with the left mouse button by clicking  
and dragging. This can be replicated on mobile if possible. There will be no keyboard input.  

The game takes place from a topdown perspective. The game starts with a single standard enemy 
approaching the treasure. If the player does nothing, the enemy will eventually make its way 
to the treasure and the game will start over. It is up to the player to click on the mouse button,
which will create the barrier and kill the enemy. Then the game truly begins. The player will 
need to learn to be aware of many things at once, always knowing how safe the treasure is and
the most efficient way of protecting it. One srategy is to kill multiple enemies with one barrier.
